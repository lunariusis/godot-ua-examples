# How to Contribute to Godot UA Examples

We are excited that you want to contribute! Here are the rules and guidelines.

## Process

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature (e.g., `feature/my-cool-example`).
3.  Add your example to the corresponding category under the `examples/` directory.
4.  Follow the example requirements below.
5.  Create a Pull Request and fill out the template.

## Example Requirements

- **Self-Contained Project:** Each example must be a standalone mini-project with its own `project.godot` file. This allows anyone to easily import and run it.
- **Godot Version:** The `README.md` file inside your example's folder must specify the minimum required Godot version (e.g., `Requires Godot 4.2.1 or newer`).
- **Difficulty & Tags:** The `README.md` file must clearly state the example's difficulty level. Allowed levels are: `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, `Advanced`. It must also provide relevant tags (e.g., `FSM`, `Character Controller`, `GDScript`).

## Quality Checklist

- Your code must follow the official [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).
- The example must be useful and focused on a single task.
- The `README.md` file must be clear and explain how to use the example.
