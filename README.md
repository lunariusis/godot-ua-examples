## Examples

Here is a list of examples currently available in this repository:

### Mechanics

*   **[2D Character State Machine](./examples/mechanics/character_state_machine_2d/)**
    *   Demonstrates a Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation for a 2D character to manage its states (idle, walk, run, jump).

*   **[Flow Worker](./examples/mechanics/flow_worker/)**
    *   Demonstrates a `FlowWorker` node that executes a sequence of actions in a predefined order. Useful for creating cutscenes, tutorials, or any scenario requiring a chain of events.

*   **[State Machine Pattern (Traffic Light)](./examples/mechanics/patterns/)**
    *   A robust implementation of the State Machine design pattern using a traffic light system as an example, with a clear separation of logic and presentation.

### Tools

*   **[Shake Component](./examples/tools/shake_component/)**
    *   A versatile `@tool` `ShakeComponent` designed to add interactive visual effects to any `Node2D` directly within the editor.
