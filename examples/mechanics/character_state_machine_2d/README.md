# 2D Character State Machine Example

**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Tags:** `FSM`, `Character Controller`, `GDScript`

This example demonstrates a Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation for a 2D character in Godot Engine. It showcases how to manage different character behaviors (idle, walk, run, jump, land) using a state-based approach, improving code organization and maintainability.

## Features

- Modular state management for player actions.
- Separation of concerns for each character behavior.
- Handles player input and transitions between states.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `character_state_machine_2d` folder as a project in Godot Engine.
2.  Run the project (F5). The main scene `main.tscn` will be launched automatically.
3.  Explore the `player/fsm` folder to understand how each state works.

## Requires

Godot 4.5 (may work on Godot 4.x or newer).
