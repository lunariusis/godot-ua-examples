# Shake Component Example

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tags:** `Effects`, `Tween`, `@tool`, `Component`, `GDScript`

This example showcases a versatile `@tool` component, `ShakeComponent`, designed to add interactive visual effects to any `Node2D` within the Godot editor. It demonstrates how to create reusable components that enhance editor workflow and provide immediate visual feedback.

## Features

- **Reusable Component:** Easily attachable to any `Node2D`-based scene node.
- **Interactive Effects:** Provides built-in effects such as shaking, scaling, and a fleeing/repel behavior, triggered by mouse hover.
- **Editor Integration (`@tool`):** Automatically sets up necessary child nodes like `Area2D` for input detection directly in the editor, streamlining development.
- **Dynamic Behavior:** Adjust effects directly in the Inspector.

## Requires

Godot 4.5 (may work on Godot 4.x or newer).
